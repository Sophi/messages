WIP!

Imagine a field of glowing, planet-like orbs floating above you, each one pulsing with an unseen cosmic rhythm. These cosmic eggs capture real cosmic rays —high-energy particles from space— and translates them into an evolving, generated soundscape. The result is an unpredictable, meditative audio experience, where Space itself becomes an invisible composer. Lying beneath them, you hear the universe whisper in tones that are ethereal, textured, and deeply immersive. It’s a piece about connection, inviting us to rethink Earth’s place in the cosmos.
