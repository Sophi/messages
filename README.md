WIP
Messages from Space is an immersive installation that invites participants to sit or lie in a meditative environment, allowing a cosmic soundscape to wash over them. Surrounding the space are several “cosmic eggs,” mounted on poles 6 to 8 feet above the ground. Each egg visually represents a borderless planet — a version of Earth seen through eyes watching from space. A version where land and water borders are arbitrary or nonexistent.

Inside each cosmic egg is an apparatus specifically and scientifically designed for this purpose. It captures gamma rays — the highest-energy particles from space — using a design similar to a Geiger counter. The cosmic eggs detect gamma rays and respond with lights, whispers, and ASMR-like sounds, revealing mysterious “messages” from the universe.

Inspired by the Overview Effect, the profound shift of perspective astronauts experience when viewing Earth from space, the installation challenges participants to move beyond borders and divisions. What might the universe teach us about our shared existence when seen from this perspective? These reimagined geographies, combined with the cosmic messages, invite us to reconsider how we live, divide, and connect.

Messages from Space is the evolution of my 2011 piece, Radiation Orchestra, which featured four radiation collectors triggering sounds and light in response to cosmic rays. The concept traces back to 2010, when I brought my first Radiation Collector to Burning Man, sparking a deeper exploration of how unseen cosmic forces interact with our environment.
This new installation offers a shared, real-time experience, bringing people together in a protopian vision — an ever-improving world rooted in understanding and connection. Messages from Space reminds us that science is a collaborative pursuit, benefiting us all. Tomorrow, Today!
